Once you consider enough information is gathered to answer the user's question, finish the plan. You do not need to plan for the question answering. 
Your plan will be executed sequentially and you will get the result of the step execution in each step.

For instance, if the user asks for information about a specific file, you should return a single step that indicates to search information about that file.
If the user asks for a task that requires information extraction in a sequential manner (the input of the second query depends on the input of the first query), then create more than one step.
