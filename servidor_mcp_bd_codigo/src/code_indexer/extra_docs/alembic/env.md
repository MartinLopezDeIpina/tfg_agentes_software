## FunctionDef run_migrations_offline
**run_migrations_offline**: The function of run_migrations_offline is to execute database migrations in an offline mode without requiring a database connection.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· None

**Code Description**: The run_migrations_offline function is designed to facilitate the execution of database migrations without the need for an active database connection. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the database is not accessible or when migrations need to be generated without direct interaction with the database engine.

The function begins by retrieving the database URL from the configuration using `config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")`. This URL is essential as it specifies the database to which the migrations will be applied, even though the actual connection to the database is not established in offline mode.

Next, the function configures the migration context using `context.configure()`. This method sets up the context with several parameters:
- `url`: The database URL obtained earlier.
- `target_metadata`: This parameter typically contains the metadata of the database schema, which is necessary for the migration process.
- `literal_binds`: When set to True, this option allows the use of literal SQL statements, which can enhance performance by avoiding the need for parameter binding.
- `dialect_opts`: This dictionary can include additional options specific to the SQL dialect being used. In this case, it specifies the parameter style as "named".

After configuring the context, the function initiates a transaction block using `with context.begin_transaction():`. This ensures that all migration operations are executed within a single transaction, providing atomicity and consistency.

Finally, the function calls `context.run_migrations()`, which executes the actual migration commands defined in the migration scripts. This method processes the migration scripts and applies the necessary changes to the database schema as specified.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `target_metadata` is correctly defined and corresponds to the current state of the database schema. Additionally, since this function operates in offline mode, it is crucial to have the migration scripts prepared and tested to avoid issues during execution.
## FunctionDef run_migrations_online
**run_migrations_online**: The function of run_migrations_online is to execute database migrations in an online mode by establishing a connection to the database.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The run_migrations_online function is designed to facilitate the execution of database migrations when the application is running in an online environment. The function begins by creating a database engine using the configuration settings specified in the application's configuration file. This is achieved through the `engine_from_config` method, which retrieves the necessary settings from the configuration section defined by `config.config_ini_section`. The prefix "sqlalchemy." is used to filter the relevant configuration options, and a `NullPool` is specified to manage the database connections without maintaining a connection pool.

Once the engine is created, the function establishes a connection to the database using a context manager (`with connectable.connect() as connection:`). This ensures that the connection is properly managed and closed after use. The connection is then passed to the migration context via `context.configure`, along with the target metadata that defines the database schema.

The function proceeds to initiate a transaction using `context.begin_transaction()`, which allows for the execution of the migration commands within a transactional scope. Finally, the `context.run_migrations()` method is called to perform the actual migration operations, applying any pending changes to the database schema.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the database configuration is correctly set up in the configuration file before invoking this function. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to manage any potential issues that may arise during the migration process.
