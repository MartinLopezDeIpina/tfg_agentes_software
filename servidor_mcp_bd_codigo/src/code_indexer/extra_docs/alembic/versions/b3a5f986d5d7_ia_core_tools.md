## FunctionDef upgrade
**upgrade**: The function of upgrade is to apply database schema changes by creating a new table named 'App'.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The upgrade function is responsible for executing a database migration using Alembic, which is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy. Within this function, a new table called 'App' is created in the database. The table consists of two columns: 'app_id' and 'name'. 

The 'app_id' column is defined as an integer type and is marked as non-nullable, meaning that every record in the 'App' table must have a value for this column. This column serves as the primary key for the table, ensuring that each entry is uniquely identifiable. The 'name' column is defined as a string type with a maximum length of 255 characters and is nullable, allowing for the possibility of having records without a name.

The primary key constraint is explicitly defined on the 'app_id' column, which enforces the uniqueness of values in this column and optimizes the performance of queries that search for records based on the 'app_id'.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that this function is executed in the correct context of a database migration. Any changes made by this function will affect the database schema, and it is advisable to review the migration script before applying it to a production environment. Additionally, developers should consider the implications of adding new tables on existing data and application logic.
## FunctionDef downgrade
**downgrade**: The function of downgrade is to reverse a database migration by dropping the 'App' table.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The downgrade function is designed to be used in the context of database migrations managed by Alembic, a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy. This function specifically executes a command to drop the table named 'App' from the database. The command is automatically generated by Alembic, which means it is created based on the previous migration state. When this function is called, it will remove the 'App' table and all of its associated data from the database. It is important to note that this action is irreversible through this function, meaning that once the table is dropped, all data contained within it will be lost unless a backup exists.

**Note**: Users should exercise caution when using the downgrade function, as dropping a table will result in permanent data loss. It is advisable to ensure that any necessary data is backed up before executing this function. Additionally, this function should be used in the context of a migration rollback, typically when reverting to a previous version of the database schema.
