## FunctionDef upgrade
**upgrade**: The function of upgrade is to insert initial model data into the 'Model' table in the database.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The upgrade function is responsible for executing a database migration using Alembic, which is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy. Within this function, the op.bulk_insert method is utilized to insert multiple rows of data into the 'Model' table. The 'Model' table is defined with three columns: 'provider', 'name', and 'description', all of which are of type String. 

The function includes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a model with its associated attributes. The first entry corresponds to a model named 'gpt-4o-mini' provided by 'OpenAI', which is described as a multimodal model suitable for smaller tasks. The second entry is for the 'GPT-4o' model, also provided by 'OpenAI', which is characterized as a high-intelligence model designed for complex tasks. 

This function is automatically generated by Alembic, and while it provides a foundational setup for the 'Model' table, developers are encouraged to review and adjust the generated code as necessary to fit their specific application requirements.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the 'Model' table exists before executing this function, as it relies on the table structure being present in the database. Additionally, any changes to the model data or structure should be carefully managed to maintain data integrity.
## FunctionDef downgrade
**downgrade**: The function of downgrade is to reverse the changes made by a previous database migration.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**: The downgrade function is currently defined but does not contain any executable code. It includes a comment indicating that it is an auto-generated command by Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy. The comment suggests that the user should adjust the function as necessary to implement the desired rollback behavior. Since the function body consists solely of the `pass` statement, it effectively does nothing when called. This implies that the function is a placeholder for future implementation, where the user is expected to define the specific operations needed to revert the database schema to a previous state.

**Note**: It is important to implement the necessary logic within this function to ensure that any changes made by the corresponding upgrade function can be properly undone. Without this implementation, calling the downgrade function will not affect the database, potentially leading to inconsistencies if a rollback is required.
