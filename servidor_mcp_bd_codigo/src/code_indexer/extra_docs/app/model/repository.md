## ClassDef Repository
**Repository**: The function of Repository is to represent a data model for storing information about repositories in a database.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· repository_id: An Integer that serves as the primary key for the Repository table.
· name: A String with a maximum length of 255 characters that holds the name of the repository.
· type: A String with a maximum length of 45 characters that indicates the type of the repository.
· status: A String with a maximum length of 45 characters that represents the current status of the repository.
· app_id: An Integer that acts as a foreign key linking to the App table, which can be nullable.

**Code Description**: The Repository class inherits from the Base class, indicating that it is part of a SQLAlchemy ORM model. The class is mapped to a database table named 'Repository'. The primary key for this table is defined by the `repository_id` attribute, ensuring each repository entry is unique. The `name`, `type`, and `status` attributes provide additional descriptive information about the repository, while the `app_id` attribute establishes a relationship with the App class, allowing for the association of a repository with a specific application. The `app` attribute creates a bidirectional relationship with the App class, enabling access to the related repositories from the App side. Additionally, the class defines relationships with the Resource and Agent classes, allowing for lazy loading of related resources and agents, respectively.

**Note**: When using this class, it is important to ensure that the foreign key relationship with the App class is correctly established to maintain data integrity. The lazy loading feature for resources and agents can optimize performance by loading related data only when accessed.
