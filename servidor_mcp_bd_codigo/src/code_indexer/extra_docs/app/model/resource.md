## ClassDef Resource
**Resource**: The function of Resource is to represent a resource entity in the database, encapsulating its properties and relationships.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· resource_id: An Integer that serves as the primary key for the Resource table, uniquely identifying each resource.
· name: A String with a maximum length of 255 characters that stores the name of the resource.
· uri: A String with a maximum length of 1000 characters that holds the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) associated with the resource.
· type: A String with a maximum length of 45 characters that indicates the type of the resource.
· status: A String with a maximum length of 45 characters that reflects the current status of the resource.
· repository_id: An Integer that acts as a foreign key linking to the repository_id in the Repository table, allowing for an optional association with a repository.

**Code Description**: The Resource class inherits from the Base class, indicating that it is part of a SQLAlchemy ORM model. The class defines a table named 'Resource' in the database, which includes several columns representing the attributes of a resource. The resource_id column is designated as the primary key, ensuring each resource can be uniquely identified. The name, uri, type, and status columns store essential information about the resource, while the repository_id column establishes a relationship with the Repository class through a foreign key constraint. This relationship is facilitated by the repository attribute, which uses SQLAlchemy's relationship function to create a bidirectional link between the Resource and Repository classes. The back_populates argument ensures that changes to one side of the relationship are reflected in the other, maintaining data integrity.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the repository_id is nullable, allowing for resources that may not be associated with any repository. When using this class, developers should be aware of the relationships defined and ensure that the corresponding Repository entries exist when linking resources to repositories.
