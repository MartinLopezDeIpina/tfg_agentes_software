## ClassDef App
**App**: The function of App is to represent a user model class that interacts with the application's database.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· app_id: An integer that serves as the primary key for the App model, uniquely identifying each application instance.
· name: A string with a maximum length of 255 characters that stores the name of the application.

**Code Description**: The App class is a model that inherits from the Base class, which is typically part of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework such as SQLAlchemy. This class is mapped to the 'App' table in the database, allowing for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of application records. The app_id attribute is defined as an integer and is designated as the primary key, ensuring that each application has a unique identifier. The name attribute is a string that holds the application's name, limited to 255 characters to maintain database integrity and performance.

In addition to these attributes, the App class establishes relationships with two other models: Repository and Agent. The repositories attribute creates a one-to-many relationship with the Repository model, allowing an application to have multiple associated repositories. The agents attribute similarly establishes a one-to-many relationship with the Agent model, indicating that an application can have multiple agents linked to it. Both relationships are set to lazy loading, meaning that related records will only be loaded from the database when they are accessed, optimizing performance and resource usage.

**Note**: When using the App class, ensure that the database schema is properly set up to include the 'App' table with the specified columns. Additionally, be aware of the relationships defined, as they will affect how data is queried and manipulated within the application.
