## ClassDef Agent
**Agent**: The function of Agent is to represent an entity that interacts with a system, encapsulating its properties and relationships with other entities.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· agent_id: An integer that serves as the primary key for the Agent table, uniquely identifying each agent.
· name: A string with a maximum length of 255 characters that holds the name of the agent.
· description: A string with a maximum length of 1000 characters that provides a detailed description of the agent.
· system_prompt: A text field that contains the system prompt associated with the agent.
· prompt_template: A text field that defines the template for prompts used by the agent.
· type: A string with a maximum length of 45 characters that specifies the type of the agent.
· status: A string with a maximum length of 45 characters that indicates the current status of the agent.
· model: A string with a maximum length of 45 characters that identifies the model associated with the agent.
· model_id: An integer that serves as a foreign key linking to the model_id in the Model table, allowing for a nullable relationship.
· repository_id: An integer that serves as a foreign key linking to the repository_id in the Repository table, allowing for a nullable relationship.
· app_id: An integer that serves as a foreign key linking to the app_id in the App table, allowing for a nullable relationship.
· has_memory: A boolean indicating whether the agent has memory capabilities.

**Code Description**: The Agent class is a representation of an agent entity within a relational database, inheriting from a base class called Base. It defines a table named 'Agent' with various attributes that describe the agent's characteristics and relationships with other entities. The primary key for this table is agent_id, which uniquely identifies each agent. The class includes several string attributes to hold the agent's name, description, type, status, and model. Additionally, it establishes foreign key relationships with the Model, Repository, and App tables through model_id, repository_id, and app_id, respectively. These relationships are defined using SQLAlchemy's relationship function, allowing for easy access to related data. The has_memory attribute indicates whether the agent possesses memory functionality, which may influence its behavior and capabilities within the system.

**Note**: When using the Agent class, it is important to ensure that foreign key relationships are properly maintained to avoid integrity issues in the database. Additionally, the nullable attributes should be handled appropriately to account for cases where an agent may not be associated with a model, repository, or app.
