**User**: The function of User is to represent a user entity in the application.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· user_id: An integer that serves as the primary key for the User table, uniquely identifying each user.

**Code Description**: The User class is a model that inherits from the Base class, which is typically part of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework such as SQLAlchemy. This class defines the structure of the 'User' table in the database. The `__tablename__` attribute specifies the name of the table as 'User'. The `user_id` attribute is defined as an Integer type and is marked as the primary key, ensuring that each user can be uniquely identified. The `email` and `name` attributes are both defined as String types with a maximum length of 255 characters, allowing for the storage of user email addresses and names, respectively. This class serves as a blueprint for creating user objects and interacting with the corresponding database table.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the email addresses are unique if required by the application logic, and handle any potential exceptions that may arise from database operations.
