## ClassDef Model
**Model**: The function of Model is to represent a user model in the database.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
路 model_id: An integer that serves as the primary key for the model, uniquely identifying each instance of the Model class.
路 provider: A string with a maximum length of 45 characters that stores the name of the provider associated with the model.
路 name: A string with a maximum length of 45 characters that holds the name of the model.
路 description: A string with a maximum length of 1000 characters that provides a detailed description of the model.

**Code Description**: The Model class is a representation of a user model in a database, inheriting from a base class called Base. It is mapped to a database table named 'Model'. The class defines four attributes that correspond to the columns in the database table. The `model_id` attribute is an integer and acts as the primary key, ensuring that each record in the table is unique. The `provider`, `name`, and `description` attributes are string types with specified maximum lengths, allowing for the storage of relevant information about the model. This structure facilitates the management and retrieval of user model data within the application.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the values assigned to the attributes adhere to the specified length constraints to avoid database errors. Additionally, the primary key must be unique for each instance of the Model class to maintain data integrity.
