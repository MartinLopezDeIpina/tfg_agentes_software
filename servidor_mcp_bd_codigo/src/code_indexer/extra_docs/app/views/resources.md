## FunctionDef resources(app_id)
**resources**: The function of resources is to render the resources HTML template with a specific application ID.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· app_id: This parameter represents the unique identifier for the application whose resources are being accessed.

**Code Description**: The resources function takes a single parameter, app_id, which is expected to be a valid identifier for an application. When the function is called, it utilizes the `render_template` function from the Flask framework to generate an HTML page. The specific template being rendered is 'resources/resources.html'. The app_id parameter is passed to the template, allowing the HTML to dynamically display content related to the specified application. This function is typically used in web applications to serve resource-related information to users based on the application they are interested in.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the app_id passed to the function is valid and corresponds to an existing application in the system. If an invalid app_id is provided, the rendered template may not display the expected information or could lead to errors.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be an HTML page displaying resource details for the application with the ID '123', showing relevant information such as documentation links, usage statistics, and support contacts specific to that application.
## FunctionDef resource(app_id, resource_id)
**resource**: The function of resource is to render a specific HTML template for a given application and resource.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: app_id - This parameter represents the unique identifier for the application that is being referenced. It is essential for determining which application's resources to display.
· parameter2: resource_id - This parameter signifies the unique identifier for the specific resource within the application. It is crucial for fetching the correct resource details to be rendered.

**Code Description**: The resource function is designed to facilitate the rendering of an HTML template named 'resources/resource.html'. It takes two parameters: app_id and resource_id. These parameters are passed to the render_template function, which is a part of the Flask framework. The render_template function is responsible for combining the specified HTML template with the provided data (app_id and resource_id) to generate a complete HTML page. This page will display the relevant information pertaining to the specified application and resource. The use of these parameters allows for dynamic content generation, ensuring that the correct data is displayed based on the identifiers provided.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that both app_id and resource_id are valid and correspond to existing entries in the database or application context. Failure to provide valid identifiers may result in errors or the rendering of incorrect information.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be an HTML page displaying details about a specific resource, such as:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Resource Details</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Resource Details for App ID: 123</h1>
    <p>Resource ID: 456</p>
    <p>Description: This is a detailed description of the resource.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
