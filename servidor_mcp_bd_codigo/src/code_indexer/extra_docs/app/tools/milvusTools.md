## FunctionDef index_resource(resource)
**index_resource**: The function of index_resource is to index a resource by loading its content, splitting it into chunks, and adding it to a Milvus collection.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· resource: An object representing the resource to be indexed, which contains the repository_id and uri attributes.

**Code Description**: The index_resource function is designed to facilitate the indexing of a resource's content into a Milvus database. It begins by creating an instance of the PyPDFLoader, which is responsible for loading the content of a PDF file specified by the resource's uri. The path to the PDF file is constructed using the repository_id and uri attributes of the resource object. The loader is configured to not extract images from the PDF.

Once the content is loaded, the function utilizes the CharacterTextSplitter to divide the loaded pages into smaller, manageable chunks. This is done with a specified chunk size of 10 characters and no overlap between chunks. The resulting chunks are stored in the docs variable.

Next, the function calls create_milvus_instance, passing the repository_id from the resource object as an argument. This function is essential as it establishes a connection to the Milvus database, creating an instance configured for the specific repository. The Milvus instance is then used to add the previously split document chunks to the corresponding collection.

The index_resource function plays a crucial role in the overall workflow of resource management within the application. It is directly related to other functions that interact with the Milvus database, such as delete_resource, search_similar_resources, and get_milvus_retriever, all of which rely on the functionality provided by create_milvus_instance to perform their respective operations.

**Note**: Ensure that the resource object passed to the index_resource function contains valid repository_id and uri attributes. Additionally, verify that the necessary environment variables for the Milvus connection are correctly set to avoid connection issues.
## FunctionDef delete_resource(resource)
**delete_resource**: The function of delete_resource is to delete a resource from a Milvus collection based on its source.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· resource: An object representing the resource to be deleted, which contains the repository_id and uri attributes.

**Code Description**: The delete_resource function is designed to remove a specific resource from a Milvus collection. It begins by creating an instance of the Milvus database using the create_milvus_instance function, which requires the repository_id of the resource. This instance is essential for performing operations on the Milvus database. 

Next, the function constructs an expression (expr) that specifies the criteria for deletion. This expression is formatted to match the source of the resource, which is constructed using a base folder path, the repository_id, and the uri of the resource. The expression is structured as `source == '{REPO_BASE_FOLDER}/{resource.repository_id}/{resource.uri}'`, ensuring that the correct resource is targeted for deletion.

Finally, the function calls the delete method on the Milvus instance, passing the constructed expression as an argument. This action instructs Milvus to delete the resource that matches the specified criteria from the collection.

The delete_resource function is part of a broader set of functionalities that interact with the Milvus database. It relies on create_milvus_instance to establish a connection to the database, which is a common pattern in this module. Other functions, such as index_resource and search_similar_resources, also utilize create_milvus_instance to perform their respective tasks, indicating that establishing a Milvus instance is a foundational step for various resource management operations within the application.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the REPO_BASE_FOLDER constant is correctly defined in the environment where this function is used, as it is critical for constructing the correct source path for the resource to be deleted.
## FunctionDef search_similar_resources(repository_id, embed, RESULTS)
**search_similar_resources**: The function of search_similar_resources is to search for similar resources in a Milvus collection based on an embedding.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· repository_id: An identifier for the repository, used to construct the collection name.
· embed: The embedding vector used to perform the similarity search.
· RESULTS: The number of similar resources to return (default is 5).

**Code Description**: The search_similar_resources function is designed to facilitate the retrieval of resources that are similar to a given embedding vector within a specified Milvus collection. It begins by invoking the create_milvus_instance function, which establishes a connection to the Milvus database configured for the specified repository_id. This connection is essential for performing operations on the Milvus collection.

Once the Milvus instance is created, the function calls the similarity_search_with_score_by_vector method on the Milvus instance. This method takes the provided embedding (embed) and the number of results to return (RESULTS) as parameters. It executes a similarity search in the Milvus collection, returning the most relevant resources along with their similarity scores.

The search_similar_resources function is integral to applications that require finding related resources based on vector embeddings, such as recommendation systems or content-based retrieval systems. It relies on the create_milvus_instance function to ensure that the connection to the Milvus database is properly established, thus enabling effective resource management and retrieval.

**Note**: Ensure that the repository_id provided corresponds to a valid collection in the Milvus database, and that the embed parameter is a properly formatted vector suitable for similarity searching.

**Output Example**: A possible return value of the search_similar_resources function could be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a similar resource and its associated similarity score, such as [(resource1, score1), (resource2, score2), (resource3, score3), (resource4, score4), (resource5, score5)].

This identifier is crucial as it is used to construct the collection name that the Milvus instance will utilize.

Internally, the function calls create_milvus_instance, passing the repository_id as an argument. The create_milvus_instance function is responsible for initializing a Milvus instance with the appropriate embeddings and connection parameters. It creates an instance of OpenAIEmbeddings, which is essential for generating embeddings for the data stored in Milvus. The collection name is constructed by concatenating a predefined prefix (COLLECTION_PREFIX) with the string representation of the repository_id. The resulting Milvus instance is then returned by the create_milvus_instance function.

After obtaining the Milvus instance, the get_milvus_retriever function calls the as_retriever method on the Milvus instance. This method converts the Milvus instance into a retriever, which can be used for querying and retrieving data from the Milvus database.

The get_milvus_retriever function is integral to the workflow of resource management within the application, as it provides a streamlined way to access the Milvus database for retrieval operations. It is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be fetched based on specific queries or embeddings.
