## ClassDef PGVectorTools
**PGVectorTools**: The function of PGVectorTools is to manage and manipulate pgvector tables in a PostgreSQL database for storing and retrieving vector embeddings.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class.
· db: An instance of the SQLAlchemy database engine used for database operations.
· Session: A session object for interacting with the database.

**Code Description**: The PGVectorTools class is designed to facilitate the creation, indexing, deletion, and searching of vector embeddings stored in a PostgreSQL database using the pgvector extension. Upon initialization, the class requires a SQLAlchemy database engine as a parameter, which it uses to establish a session for executing database operations.

The class contains several methods:

1. **create_pgvector_table(self, repository_id)**: This method creates a pgvector table for a specified repository if it does not already exist. The table is named using a predefined prefix combined with the repository ID. The table structure includes an auto-incrementing primary key, a text field for the source, and a vector field for storing embeddings of size 1536.

2. **index_resource(self, resource)**: This method is responsible for indexing a resource by loading its content, splitting it into manageable chunks, and adding these chunks to the pgvector table. It utilizes a PDF loader to read the content of the resource and a text splitter to divide the content into smaller segments. The method then creates a PGVector instance to add the documents to the database.

3. **delete_resource(self, resource)**: This method deletes a specified resource from the pgvector table. It first retrieves similar documents based on the resource's source using a similarity search. The results are collected, and the corresponding IDs are extracted before executing a delete operation on the vector store.

4. **search_similar_resources(self, repository_id, embed, RESULTS=5)**: This method searches for resources similar to a given embedding within the pgvector table. It utilizes the PGVector instance to perform a similarity search based on the provided embedding and returns a specified number of results.

5. **get_pgvector_retriever(self, repository_id)**: This method returns a retriever object for the pgvector collection associated with a specific repository. The retriever can be used to fetch documents from the vector store based on various criteria.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the pgvector extension is installed and properly configured in the PostgreSQL database before using this class. Additionally, the embeddings used in the PGVector instance should be compatible with the vector size defined in the table schema.

**Output Example**: An example output of the search_similar_resources method might look like this:
[
    { "id": 1, "source": "document1.pdf", "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.1536] },
    { "id": 2, "source": "document2.pdf", "embedding": [0.3, 0.4, ..., 0.1536] },
    ...
]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, db)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the PGVectorTools with a SQLAlchemy engine.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· db: An instance of a SQLAlchemy database engine that provides access to the database session.

**Code Description**: The __init__ function is a constructor method for the PGVectorTools class. It is responsible for initializing the instance of the class with a provided SQLAlchemy database engine. When an object of PGVectorTools is created, this method is called with the 'db' parameter, which is expected to be an instance of a SQLAlchemy engine. Inside the method, the 'Session' attribute is set to the session of the provided database engine, allowing for database operations to be performed. Additionally, the 'db' attribute is assigned the passed database engine instance, enabling further interactions with the database throughout the class methods.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the 'db' parameter passed to this function is a valid SQLAlchemy engine instance. This will ensure that the PGVectorTools class can properly manage database sessions and perform necessary operations without encountering errors.

### FunctionDef create_pgvector_table(self, repository_id)
**create_pgvector_table**: The function of create_pgvector_table is to create a pgvector table for a specified repository if it does not already exist.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· repository_id: This is an identifier for the repository for which the pgvector table is to be created.

**Code Description**: The create_pgvector_table function is designed to establish a new table in a PostgreSQL database that utilizes the pgvector extension for handling vector embeddings. The function begins by constructing the table name using a predefined prefix (COLLECTION_PREFIX) concatenated with the string representation of the repository_id parameter. This ensures that each repository has a uniquely named table.

A session is initiated using self.Session(), which allows for interaction with the database. Within a try block, the function executes a SQL command that creates a table if it does not already exist. The table structure includes three columns: an 'id' column that serves as the primary key and is automatically incremented (SERIAL), a 'source' column for storing text data, and an 'embedding' column that is defined as a VECTOR type with a dimension of 1536. This dimension should be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the embedding model being utilized.

After executing the SQL command, the session commits the transaction to ensure that the changes are saved to the database. Finally, the session is closed in the finally block to release the database connection, regardless of whether the operation was successful or if an error occurred.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the pgvector extension is installed and enabled in the PostgreSQL database before using this function. Additionally, the COLLECTION_PREFIX should be defined in the context where this function is used to avoid any undefined variable errors.
***
### FunctionDef index_resource(self, resource)
**index_resource**: The function of index_resource is to index a resource by loading its content, splitting it into chunks, and adding it to the pgvector table.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· resource: An object representing the resource to be indexed, which contains information such as repository_id and uri.

**Code Description**: The index_resource function is designed to process a given resource for indexing purposes. It begins by creating an instance of PyPDFLoader, which is responsible for loading the content of a PDF file located at a specific path. This path is constructed using the repository_id and uri attributes of the resource object. The loader is configured to not extract images from the PDF.

Once the PDF is loaded, the function utilizes the CharacterTextSplitter to divide the loaded pages into smaller, manageable chunks of text. The chunk size is set to 10 characters, with no overlap between chunks, ensuring that each piece of text is distinct.

After the text has been split into chunks, the function initializes a PGVector instance. This instance is configured with OpenAIEmbeddings for generating embeddings, a collection name that is prefixed with a constant COLLECTION_PREFIX followed by the resource's repository_id, and a database connection obtained from the instance's db.engine. The use_jsonb parameter is set to True, indicating that JSONB format will be used for storage.

Finally, the function adds the split documents (text chunks) to the PGVector instance, effectively indexing the resource's content in the pgvector table for later retrieval and analysis.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the resource object passed to the function contains valid repository_id and uri attributes. Additionally, the database connection must be properly established before invoking this function to avoid runtime errors.
***
### FunctionDef delete_resource(self, resource)
**delete_resource**: The function of delete_resource is to delete a specified resource from the pgvector table using the langchain vector store.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· resource: An object representing the resource to be deleted, which contains attributes such as repository_id and uri.

**Code Description**: The delete_resource function is designed to remove a resource from a pgvector table. It begins by initializing a PGVector instance, which is configured with the necessary parameters including embeddings from OpenAIEmbeddings, a collection name derived from the resource's repository_id, and a database connection. The use_jsonb parameter is set to True, indicating that JSONB data types will be utilized.

Next, the function performs a similarity search on the vector store with an empty query string and a filter that specifies the source of the resource based on its repository_id and uri. This search is intended to retrieve up to 1000 results that match the specified criteria. The results of this search are printed to the console for debugging or informational purposes.

Following the retrieval of results, the function constructs an array of document IDs from the results. This array is also printed to the console. Finally, the function calls the delete method on the vector store, passing in the array of IDs to remove the corresponding resources from the pgvector table.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the resource object passed to the function contains valid repository_id and uri attributes, as these are critical for the filtering process during the similarity search. Additionally, the function prints the results and IDs to the console, which may be useful for debugging but could be removed or replaced with proper logging in a production environment.

**search_similar_resources**: The function of search_similar_resources is to search for similar resources in the pgvector table using a langchain vector store.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· repository_id: An identifier for the specific repository in which to search for similar resources.  
· embed: A vector representation of the resource to be compared against others in the database.  
· RESULTS: An optional parameter that specifies the number of similar resources to return, defaulting to 5.

**Code Description**: The search_similar_resources function is designed to facilitate the retrieval of resources that are similar to a given input resource based on vector embeddings. It begins by initializing a PGVector instance, which serves as a connection to the vector store. This instance is configured with the following parameters: the embeddings are generated using OpenAIEmbeddings, the collection name is dynamically created by appending the repository_id to a predefined COLLECTION_PREFIX, and the database connection is established through self.db.engine. The use_jsonb parameter is set to True, indicating that JSONB data types will be utilized for storage.

Once the vector store is set up, the function performs a similarity search by invoking the similarity_search_by_vector method. This method takes the input embedding (embed) and the number of results to return (k), which is specified by the RESULTS parameter. The function ultimately returns the results of this similarity search, providing a list of resources that are most similar to the input vector.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the embeddings used for the search are properly generated and that the repository_id corresponds to an existing collection in the database. The RESULTS parameter can be adjusted based on the desired number of similar resources to retrieve.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value could be a list of resource objects, each containing attributes such as resource_id, similarity_score, and metadata, for example:
```json
[
    {"resource_id": "123", "similarity_score": 0.95, "metadata": {...}},
    {"resource_id": "456", "similarity_score": 0.93, "metadata": {...}},
    {"resource_id": "789", "similarity_score": 0.91, "metadata": {...}}
]
